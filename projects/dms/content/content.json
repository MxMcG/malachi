            "As the world approaches the triumphant return of Jesus the Messiah, a gray and certainly satanic sentiment fills the realm of modern thought. An unpleasant trickery has led millions, if not billions of souls astray from an everlasting relationship with their maker.",
            "Amongst his disciples, Jesus claims, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me. If you had really known me, you would know who my Father is. From now on, you do know him and have seen him!” John 14: 6-7.",
            "Jesus’ teaching is blatantly straightforward. The the idea that all world-views contain truth should not make sense to the follower of Christ. Western society, particularly that of the United States, has blurred the basic concept of absolute truth. Here, it is considered offensive to claim that one belief is correct over another. This society does not believe in whole truth at all, therefore there is a lack of dialogue and debate between proponents of differing truth claims.",
            "In 1 Kings 8, the prophet Elijah comes face to face with those of differing beliefs. He says: “You prophets of Baal, pray to your god, and I will pray to the Lord. The god who answers by setting fire to his wood is the true God.",
            "The scriptures reveal to us that Elijah’s God triumphs, while the prophets of Baal are brought to utter shame and subsequent death. Fast forward to the latter days: the year 2017. The world’s central dilemma is not wealth inequality or racial tension, rather, it is the fact that truth is indeed real. At this moment, enormous populations of this earth have devoted their hearts to conflicting truth claims. Is this not an inherent dilemma?",
            "“Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!” At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds. John 8: 58-59",
            "Let anyone who is willing to be comforted by the unshakable truth be assured that life was created by a particular spiritual being: the God of the Bible. Jesus of Nazareth really was born of a virgin woman, named Mary, in Israel around 2,000 years ago. This man really is the beloved Son of God, or Messiah. Praise be the God our Savior and thanks be to the Lord Jesus Christ for not abandoning us in our sin and confusion. He is always faithful to those who are willing to believe that He is their loving Creator."
