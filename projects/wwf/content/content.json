I learned the greatest asset a business could have is its people. It was evident after working four years in a successful startup company in Carlsbad, CA, because the people were incredible and so talented. Over time at the startup the work with my hands became less and less. My desk crept higher up into the office corner. It took a tough conversation with my business partners to see if this was the place for me. I followed with the response, \"I just want to work with my hands, talk to people, and Love people.\" Here is where we begin our journey WestWard; working with our hands and Loving people."
