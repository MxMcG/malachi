I put this piece of wisdom to practice and made it through business school, made investments with the resources that were available to me, and invested my time into people. I learned the greatest asset a business could have is its people. It was evident after working four years in a successful startup company in Carlsbad, CA, because the people were incredible and so talented. Now using the same mentality of working for people rather than money begins our new journey WestWard; working with our hands and Loving people."
